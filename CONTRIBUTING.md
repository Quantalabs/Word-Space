# Contribution Guidelines
For anyone contributing, there are two things you need to know, 1) thank you, and 2) you need to follow a couple rules. Here they are...

## New Updates
If you are adding a feature, make an issue for it and tag it with the _Contribution_ tag. This way, I can see what features you've added. Or you can fork it and you don't have to do anything else.

## Fixing Issues
When  fixing an issue, make sure that you comment on the issue that you've fixed it and then _I_ can close it.

## Fixing Unknown Errors
Just note to me that you have fixed it.

# _Prefered_ Way of Contribution

# Forking
If you fork, that's the best way to contribute since I can view updates and merge the best updates into the next release.\

# That's It
That's all there is to contributing so go out and start contributing!
